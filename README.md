## About

This repository is a study about High Computing Performance, where i was developing a project for an UFRJ class.

There's a list of folders that contains every exercise that i've solved in this chair.

## List of Exercises

### [Exercise 1](https://github.com/DantasB/high-performance-computing/tree/main/First_Exercise)

In this exercise i've learned about Fortran and C differences about data storage and improved my shell abilities.

### [Exercise 2](https://github.com/DantasB/high-performance-computing/tree/main/Second_Exercise)

In this exercise i've learned about c profiling using gprof and some code optimizations.

### [Exercise 3](https://github.com/DantasB/high-performance-computing/tree/main/Third_Exercise)

In this exercise i've learned about openmp and about parallelism in c++.

### [Exercise 4](https://github.com/DantasB/high-performance-computing/tree/main/Fourth_Exercise)

In this exercise i've learned about benchmarks, how to run and optimize it.

### [Exercise 5](https://github.com/DantasB/high-performance-computing/tree/main/Fifth_Exercise)

In this exercise i've learned how to build a roofline graph and its importance for a code.
